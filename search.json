    "text": "After Jordan Love’s second full season as the starting quarterback for the Green Bay Packers, fans and stat lovers started to see some patterns and crazy coincidences in the numbers being put up by No. 10 and the last franchise quarterback, Aaron Rodgers.\nRodgers left the Packers for the Jets in 2022, 14 years after Brett Favre did the same. Both Rodgers and Favre then struggled with injury in their first seasons with New York, and the Jets didn’t make the playoffs, neither did the Packers with their new quarterback.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(patchwork)\nlibrary(gt)\n\n\nOn X, @ShowTymeZach saw the pattern:\n\n\nCode\nFRL1 &lt;- read_csv(\"data/FRL1.csv\")\n\n\n“Let’s look at Brett Favre’s and Aaron Rodgers stats in their first full season compared to Jordan Love’s this season:\n\n\nCode\nFRL1 |&gt;\n  gt() |&gt;\n  cols_label(\n    Games = \"Games Played\",\n    AttCmp = \"Attempts vs Complete\",\n    PassTDs = \"Passing TDs\",\n    Ints = \"Interceptions\",\n    PassRt = \"Passer Rating\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlayer\nGames Played\nAttempts vs Complete\nPassYds\nPassing TDs\nInterceptions\nPasser Rating\n\n\n\n\nBrett Favre\n16\n318-522\n3303\n19\n24\n72.2\n\n\nAaron Rodgers\n16\n341-536\n4038\n28\n13\n93.8\n\n\nJordan Love\n15\n321-514\n3587\n27\n11\n91.8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne less start, and yet Love still has comparable stats to first year starts of 2 hall of fame careers.”\nZach wasn’t the only one. However, in the big picture, how many quarterbacks share similar stat lines? As much as I loved the idea of these Packer quarterbacks being magically connected in stats, and maybe results, I knew I needed to dig deeper too see if there really was a pattern here.\nI started by taking the first starting season of each quarterback in question, and looking at their passing efficiency.\nFor reference, Favre will be represented with green, Rodgers with gold, and Love with black. The reference lines display the league average for the respective season.\n\n\nCode\nF1 &lt;- read_csv(\"data/Favre2.csv\")\nR1 &lt;- read_csv(\"data/Rodgers1.csv\")\nL1 &lt;- read_csv(\"data/Love1.csv\")\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(data=F1, aes(x=P_CmpP, y=P_Rate, size=P_TD), color=203731, alpha = .6) +\n  geom_point(data=R1, aes(x=P_CmpP, y=P_Rate, size=P_TD), color=\"gold\", alpha = .6) +\n  geom_point(data=L1, aes(x=P_CmpP, y=P_Rate, size=P_TD), alpha = .6) + theme_minimal() +\n    scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(35, 45, 55, 65, 75, 85, 95), limits = c(30, 100)) +\n    labs(\n    x = \"Pass Completion Percentage\", y = \"Passer Rating\",\n    title = \"Green Bay's past three QBs: setting the bar in first year passing\",\n    subtitle = \"The Packers' franchise QBs passing game by game shows that as competition \\n improves, so do they.\",\n    caption = \"By: Emily Stoner | Source: SportsReference: Pro-Football Reference\"\n  ) + geom_vline(xintercept = 58.5, color=203731) + \n  geom_hline(yintercept = 80, color=203731) +\n     geom_vline(xintercept = 61.3, color=\"gold\") + \n  geom_hline(yintercept = 86, color=\"gold\") +\n     geom_vline(xintercept = 65.1, color=\"black\") + \n  geom_hline(yintercept = 92.2, color=\"black\") +\n    scale_size(name=\"Passing TDs\") +\n    theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 12, face = \"bold\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n#| include: false\nggsave(\"image.png\")\n\n\nChart 2: How do first year QBs compare outside of Green Bay?
