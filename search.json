    "section": "",
    "text": "After Jordan Love’s first full season as the starting quarterback for the Green Bay Packers, fans and stat lovers started to see some patterns and crazy coincidences in the numbers being put up by No. 10 and the last franchise quarterback, Aaron Rodgers.\nRodgers left the Packers for the Jets in 2022, 14 years after Brett Favre did the same. Both Rodgers and Favre then struggled with injury in their first seasons with New York, and the Jets didn’t make the playoffs, neither did the Packers with their new quarterback.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(patchwork)\nlibrary(gt)\n\n\nOn X, posted in Dec. 2023, @ShowTymeZach saw the pattern:\n\n\nCode\nFRL1 &lt;- read_csv(\"data/FRL1.csv\")\n\n\n“Let’s look at Brett Favre’s and Aaron Rodgers stats in their first full season compared to Jordan Love’s this season:\n\n\nCode\nFRL1 |&gt;\n  gt() |&gt;\n  cols_label(\n    Games = \"Games Played\",\n    AttCmp = \"Attempts vs Complete\",\n    PassTDs = \"Passing TDs\",\n    Ints = \"Interceptions\",\n    PassRt = \"Passer Rating\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlayer\nGames Played\nAttempts vs Complete\nPassYds\nPassing TDs\nInterceptions\nPasser Rating\n\n\n\n\nBrett Favre\n16\n318-522\n3303\n19\n24\n72.2\n\n\nAaron Rodgers\n16\n341-536\n4038\n28\n13\n93.8\n\n\nJordan Love\n15\n321-514\n3587\n27\n11\n91.8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne less start, and yet Love still has comparable stats to first year starts of 2 hall of fame careers.”\nZach wasn’t the only one. However, in the big picture, how many quarterbacks share similar stat lines? As much as I loved the idea of these Packer quarterbacks being magically connected in stats, and maybe results, I knew I needed to dig deeper too see if there really was a pattern here.\nI started by taking the first starting season of each quarterback in question, and looking at their passing efficiency.\nFor reference, Favre will be represented with green, Rodgers with gold, and Love with black. The reference lines display the league average for the respective season.\n\n\nCode\nF1 &lt;- read_csv(\"data/Favre2.csv\")\nR1 &lt;- read_csv(\"data/Rodgers1.csv\")\nL1 &lt;- read_csv(\"data/Love1.csv\")\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(data=F1, aes(x=P_CmpP, y=P_Rate, size=P_TD), color=203731, alpha = .6) +\n  geom_point(data=R1, aes(x=P_CmpP, y=P_Rate, size=P_TD), color=\"gold\", alpha = .6) +\n  geom_point(data=L1, aes(x=P_CmpP, y=P_Rate, size=P_TD), alpha = .6) + theme_minimal() +\n    scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(35, 45, 55, 65, 75, 85, 95), limits = c(30, 100)) +\n    labs(\n    x = \"Pass Completion Percentage\", y = \"Passer Rating\",\n    title = \"Green Bay's past three QBs: setting the bar in first year passing\",\n    subtitle = \"The Packers' franchise QBs passing game by game shows that as competition \\n improves, so do they.\",\n    caption = \"By: Emily Stoner | Source: SportsReference: Pro-Football Reference\"\n  ) + geom_vline(xintercept = 58.5, color=203731) + \n  geom_hline(yintercept = 80, color=203731) +\n     geom_vline(xintercept = 61.3, color=\"gold\") + \n  geom_hline(yintercept = 86, color=\"gold\") +\n     geom_vline(xintercept = 65.1, color=\"black\") + \n  geom_hline(yintercept = 92.2, color=\"black\") +\n    scale_size(name=\"Passing TDs\") +\n    theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 12, face = \"bold\")) + theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n#| include: false\nggsave(\"image.png\")\n\n\nSo what that tells me is that a) the standard for quarterbacks and passing game has increased over the years. Not only have the averages risen, but the performance of each Green Bay quarterback has been more efficient in their first year. b) It also tells me that Rodgers and Love show a bit more similarity in passing game than either does with Favre.\nTaking another step back, for another “big picture” check, I wanted to look at how each of these quarterbacks compare to their peers in their first season. We’ll look at this through completions, and the top-10 passers of 1992, 2008 and 2023.\n\n\nCode\nPass92 &lt;- read_csv(\"data/92Passing.csv\")\nPass93 &lt;- read_csv(\"data/93Passing.csv\")\nPass08 &lt;- read_csv(\"data/08Passing.csv\")\nPass23 &lt;- read_csv(\"data/23Passing.csv\")\n\n\n\n\nCode\nbarFavre92 &lt;- ggplot() +\n  geom_bar(\n    data = Pass92 |&gt; slice_max(Cmp, n = 10),\n    aes(x = reorder(Player, Cmp), weight = Cmp),\n    position = \"identity\",\n    fill = \"#DDDDDD\"\n  ) +\n  geom_bar(\n    data = Pass92 |&gt; filter(Player == \"Brett Favre\"),\n    aes(x = reorder(Player, Cmp), weight = Cmp),\n    fill = 203731,\n    position = \"identity\"\n  ) +\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Favre: 1992\",\n    x = \"Top 10 Passers\",\n    y = \"Season Completions\",\n    subtitle = \"No. 4 claims top-3 in season completions\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\n\n\nCode\nbarRodgers08 &lt;- ggplot() +\n  geom_bar(\n    data = Pass08 |&gt; slice_max(Cmp, n = 10),\n    aes(x = reorder(Player, Cmp), weight = Cmp),\n    position = \"identity\",\n    fill = \"#DDDDDD\"\n  ) +\n  geom_bar(\n    data = Pass08 |&gt; filter(Player == \"Aaron Rodgers\"),\n    aes(x = reorder(Player, Cmp), weight = Cmp),\n    fill = \"gold\",\n    position = \"identity\"\n  ) +\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Rodgers: 2008\",\n    x = \"Top 10 Passers\",\n    y = \"Season Completions\",\n    subtitle = \"No. 12 is seventh\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\n\n\nCode\nbarLove23 &lt;- ggplot() +\n  geom_bar(\n    data = Pass23 |&gt; slice_max(Cmp, n = 10),\n    aes(x = reorder(Player, Cmp), weight = Cmp),\n    position = \"identity\",\n    fill = \"#DDDDDD\"\n  ) +\n  geom_bar(\n    data = Pass23 |&gt; filter(Player == \"Jordan Love\"),\n    aes(x = reorder(Player, Cmp), weight = Cmp),\n    fill = \"black\",\n    position = \"identity\"\n  ) +\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Love: 2023\",\n    x = \"Top 10 Passers\",\n    y = \"Season Completions\",\n    subtitle = \"No. 10 takes eighth\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\n\n\nCode\nbarFavre92 / (barRodgers08 | barLove23)  +\n  plot_annotation(\n    title = \"NFL passing peers in Favre, Rodgers and Love's \\n strong first seasons, GB in the top-10\",\n    subtitle = \"These Packer QBs stack up well in their debuts, looking at season completions.\",\n    caption = \"By: Emily Stoner | Source: SportsReference: Pro-Football Reference\"\n  ) &\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 18, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 10),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 12),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn their starting job debut seasons, each Packer quarterback was among one other QB1 who was in his first starting season. For Favre, Stan Humphries, who sat in eighth. For Rodgers, Matt Cassel, who sat in ninth. And for Love, Sam Howell who finished the season fifth. Among all three charts, you see iconic quarterback names who together have claimed many MVPs, all-pro, and Superbowl awards.\nAgain, Love and Rodgers are showing some similarities, and their peers aren’t necessarily doing the same thing. Green Bay’s young starting quarterbacks make a mark in their first year on the field. Among veterans and legends, the Packers seem to have the passing position figured out.\nAlthough it may not be identical coaching or technique, or that there’s something in the water in Green Bay, there are certainly notable similarities between these franchise quarterbacks in Wisconsin. Among their peers, and among each other, Favre, Rodgers and Love have shown more similar than different.\nIf they’ve proven similar in the past, what about the future? Favre and Rodgers led decorated storied careers, but will Love do the same? Love has almost two seasons under his belt. Let’s look at what his game might look like in coming years if he continues to perform like his predecessors.\n\n\nCode\nL2 &lt;- read_csv(\"data/Love2.csv\")\nR2 &lt;- read_csv(\"data/Rodgers2.csv\")\nF2 &lt;- read_csv(\"data/Favre2.csv\")\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggplot() + \n  geom_step(\n    data = R2, \n    aes(x = Week, y = P_Rate), \n    color = \"gold\"\n  ) + \n  geom_step(\n    data = F2, \n    aes(x = Week, y = P_Rate), \n    color = 203731\n  ) +\n    geom_step(\n    data = L2, \n    aes(x = Week, y = P_Rate), \n    color = \"black\"\n  ) + theme_minimal() +\n    labs(\n    title = \"Favre, Rodgers, and Love: rollercoaster sophomore seasons\",\n    x = \"Week\",\n    y = \"Passer Rating\",\n    subtitle = \"Getting settled into the role isn't easy, can Love hit a high enough passing level \\n to make post-season like Favre and Rodgers?\", caption = \"By: Emily Stoner | Source: SportsReference: Pro-Football Reference\"\n  ) +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 12),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 12),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFavre and Rodgers both took the Packers to the playoffs as a wildcard in their second years as the starter, despite their rocky ratings. However, a quarterback is just one man on the field. Opponents, defense and injury also impact these turnouts. Let’s take an even bigger step back and look where Love might be headed, if this is more than a coincidence.\n\n\nCode\nLC &lt;- read_csv(\"data/LCareerP.csv\")\nRC &lt;- read_csv(\"data/RCareerP.csv\")\nFC &lt;- read_csv(\"data/FCareerP.csv\")\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggplot() + \n  geom_step(\n    data = RC, \n    aes(x = Age, y = TD), \n    color = \"gold\"\n  ) + \n  geom_step(\n    data = FC, \n    aes(x = Age, y = TD), \n    color = 203731\n  ) +\n    geom_step(\n    data = LC, \n    aes(x = Age, y = TD), \n    color = \"black\"\n  ) + theme_minimal() +\n    labs(\n    title = \"Favre and Rodgers point to: Love hasn't peaked yet.\",\n    x = \"Age (Years)\",\n    y = \"Season Passing Touchdowns\",\n    subtitle = \"No. 10's predecessors were just warming up in their 20s.\", caption = \"By: Emily Stoner | Source: SportsReference: Pro-Football Reference\"\n  ) +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 12),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 12),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll in all: Green Bay has a type. Though the three franchise quarterbacks don’t have all the same stats, and their variety points to coincidence, it’s no question that the Packers prioritize their passer. Having a rookie quarterback learn as the second-string, to step in and have a substantial impact in early years is what Wisconsin likes. They’re loyal to their process, and if the patterns continue, Love is taking the Packers to the playoffs this year, and he has a long, successful career ahead of him. I can only hope he doesn’t also go to the Jets after 16 or so seasons like the other two, but only time will tell."

    "text": "The top ATP players represent the best of the best in professional men’s tennis at any given time. However, aside from their technique, practice methods and coaching, there are many other factors that impact these players’ success and strengths.\nOne of the best American tennis players was John Isner. Isner also sits comfortably as one of the best service opponents, and happens to be 6’11”. When I started to look into the other names and stats of top servers, it seemed like height may have something to do with success.\nFrom a logical perspective, being taller would help with parts of the typical serving mechanism, although what about young kids serving? Height doesn’t make or break serving ability. To try and answer these questions, I decided to look into these stats with a bubble chart comparing height and service results. The reference lines display the ATP median for serve rating in the top-100 (277.4), and average height (185.4 cm), while the numbers show the player’s standing in serve rating.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(patchwork)\nlibrary(gt)\nlibrary(ggtext)\nlibrary(ggalt)\n\n\n\n\nCode\nServe &lt;- read_csv(\"data/ServeLeaders.csv\")\nSurface &lt;- read_csv(\"data/SurfaceATP3.csv\")\nGrip &lt;- read_csv(\"data/HandChoice.csv\")\nServeFive &lt;- Serve |&gt; filter(No&lt;=5)\nServeActive &lt;- Serve |&gt; filter(Status==\"Active\")\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggplot() + geom_vline(xintercept = 185.42) +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 277.4) +\n  geom_point(\n    data = Serve,\n    aes(\n      x = HeightCM, \n      y = ServeRate, \n      size = AvgAcePMat\n    ),\n    alpha = .3\n  )  +\n  geom_point(\n    data = ServeActive, \n    aes(x = HeightCM, y = ServeRate, size = AvgAcePMat),\n    alpha = .4,\n    color = \"green\") + geom_text(\n    data = ServeFive, aes(x = HeightCM, \n      y = ServeRate, label = No)) + geom_text_repel(\n    data = ServeFive, \n    aes(\n      x = HeightCM, \n      y = ServeRate, \n      label = Player\n    )) + scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(185, 190, 195, 200, 205, 210, 215), limits = c(182, 216)) +\n  scale_y_continuous(breaks = c(275, 280, 285, 290, 295, 300, 305, 310, 315), limits = c(275, 315)) +\n  scale_size(range = c(3, 8), name = \"Average Aces/Match\") + labs(\n    x = \"Height (cm)\", y = \"Serve Rating\",\n    title = \"The ATP's best servers are tall and hit aces\",\n    subtitle = \"The top-20 serve leaders by career show a connection between\\nheight and service dominance. Active players shown in &lt;span style = 'color:green;'&gt;green&lt;/span&gt;.\", caption = \"By: Emily Stoner | Source: ATP\"\n  ) + theme_minimal() +\n    theme(\n      plot.subtitle = element_textbox_simple(),\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 14, face = \"bold\")) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n#| include: false\nggsave(\"image.png\")\n\n\nThese top-20 servers are tall. All but three are above average in height, not to mention three of the top five are over 20 cm taller than the average. A player’s serving objective is very involved with strategy and style, so the number of aces hit in a match isn’t entirely indicative of service dominance, however, it just so happens that of the top-20 in serve rating, over half (11) also appear in the top-20 for aces per match. You can be a great server without a high ace ability, but if you’re hitting aces, you’re probably a decent server. In conclusion, being tall means you’ll probably have more serving potential, as most of the best servers are tall.\nHowever, many tennis legends and greats weren’t in that top-20 list. After all, the serve doesn’t matter all that much if you can’t win a point. Although, we do have three former No. 1’s in our top-20 servers list. What about Rafael Nadal? The King of Clay? He was dubbed as such because of his dominance on the surface, winning 90.4% of his career matches on clay, earning him 63 titles just on one surface.\nSurface is the next component to investigate, through strength and success. While, once again, learning how to succeed with this variable takes skill, surface variety is an inevitable part of pro tennis that ATP’s best have to work with. While some young stars like Carlos Alcaraz have already won grand slams on every surface, other top guys like Casper Ruud are very vocal about their surface preferences (he’s played nearly 200 matches on both hard and clay courts, but a whopping 12 on grass). Instead of using ATP rankings to look into surface leaders, I’ll be using under pressure rating (UPR) leaders as the group we take a closer look at. These players capitalize on break points and succeeding to win the games and sets that matter most. It’s no coincidence these names are some of the best in the sport. The under pressure metric displays mindset, technique and dominance, which can all be impacted by surface. These guys can handle a challenge on any surface, but here’s how their wins chalk up, grouped by surface, arranged by UPR.\n\n\nCode\nSurfaceBar &lt;- Surface |&gt; select(No, Player, UPRate, \"Hard Court Wins\", \"Grass Court Wins\", \"Clay Court Wins\", CarWLPct) |&gt; pivot_longer(\n    cols = ends_with(\"Wins\"), \n    names_to = \"Type\", \n    values_to = \"Wins\"\n  )\n\nggplot(\n  SurfaceBar, \n  aes(\n    x = reorder(Player, -No), \n    weight = Wins, \n    fill = Type)) + \n  geom_bar() + \n  coord_flip() + labs(\n    x = \"Player\", y = \"Wins, by court type\",\n    title = \"Under pressure leaders persist on all surfaces,\\nbut the most wins come on hard court\",\n    subtitle = \"These players lead the ATP in UPR, but they have a range of\\nsuccess depending on surface.\", caption = \"By: Emily Stoner | Source: TennisAbstract.com and ATP\"\n  ) + theme_minimal() +\n    theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 14, face = \"bold\")) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI will note; with two of the four grand slams being played on hard court, it makes sense that players are racking up hard court wins. But none the less, the stacked bar chart shows that even the best have strengths and weaknesses. Grass courts seem to be the weakest link for these players. This could be due to the maintenance grass courts demand, but overall, the tennis world doesn’t really prioritize grass season like it does clay and hard.\nBefore tennis players start worrying about how tall they’ll be or which surface will be their best, they pick up a racquet. The racquet is of course an essential piece of equipment for the sport, and the grip, or the way a player holds the racquet is not as standard as one may think. A forehand will be either right- or left-handed, and a backhand will be one- or two-handed, not to mention the many different grips that are used for each shot. How a player will grow up training in terms of grip will depend on personal preference, or maybe their coach, but I want to see if it matters in the rankings.\nWhile some people write with their left hand and do everything else with the right, BBC says only 10% of the world’s population is left-handed. However, according to TennisAbstract.com’s list of ranked lefties, 14.5% of the top-200 ATP players play with their left as their dominant, ranked as high as 14. Looking at the choice between one- or two-handed backhand, to my knowledge nearly every coach is going to tell you to play two-handed backhand. But there’s 16 pros in the top-200 that have made it pretty far doing otherwise, including three players in the top-20.\nInstead of looking at players in the 100s and 200s though, I want to look at the current top-15. Rankings will be ever-changing, but with the conclusion of the 2024 ATP season, now is a great time to take a look at the leaders of the tour. To vizualize this, we’re going to look at the top-15’s hand and grip choice, how they perform against righties versus lefties via dumbell chart, and how the choice of backhand grip does or doesn’t impact a player’s backhand winner success. The two lefties in the top-15 are shown with a black bar.\n\n\nCode\nOneHandB &lt;- Grip |&gt; filter(OoT==\"O\")\nLefties &lt;- Grip |&gt; filter(LoR==\"L\")\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggplot() + \n  geom_dumbbell(\n    data=Grip, \n    aes(y=reorder(Player, -No), x=vR, xend=vL),\n    size = 2,\n    colour = \"grey\",\n    colour_x = \"green\",\n    colour_xend = \"blue\" ) + geom_dumbbell(\n    data=Lefties, \n    aes(y=reorder(Player, -No), x=vR, xend=vL),\n    size = 2,\n    colour = \"black\",\n    colour_x = \"green\",\n    colour_xend = \"blue\" ) +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Winning percentage\",\n    y=\"Player, by ATP rank\",\n    title=\"The top-15 are inconsistent in winning\\ndepending on the opponent's dominant hand\", \n    subtitle = \"Righties have &lt;span style = 'color:grey;'&gt;grey&lt;/span&gt; bars, lefties have black bars. Win rates against &lt;span style = 'color:green;'&gt;righties&lt;/span&gt; are shown in green, against &lt;span style = 'color:blue;'&gt;lefties&lt;/span&gt; are shown in blue. Hand choice impacts opponents very differently.\", caption = \"By: Emily Stoner | Source: TennisAbstract.com and ATP\") +  \n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.subtitle = element_textbox_simple(),\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 14, face = \"bold\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAgain, it’s always more complicated than the stats show. Opponents are more or less skilled, have different strengths, weaknesses, etc. But this chart shows that the top-15 is really all over the place when it comes to success against opponents based on their dominant hands. Nine of the 15 perform better against righties, including the two lefties. Casper Ruud is nearly unaffected by his opponent’s dominant hand. Fritz and Rune probably don’t have a preference either. But Zverev has an impressive 80.5% win rate against lefties, while Draper has terrible odds against other lefties. Overall, maybe an opponents dominant hand really does have an impact on their own success, but clearly it varies player to player. It could be differences in training, mindset, or shot selection that lead to this, but whatever it is, this chart really surprises me.\nOne last chart: one- versus two-handed backhand winners. This player and coaching preference may not make much of a difference at lower levels, but the players that opt for one-handed backhands in the ATP are few.\n\n\nCode\nggplot() + \n  geom_bar(\n    data = Grip, \n    aes(x = reorder(Player, -No), weight = BHWPct), fill = \"grey\") + geom_bar(\n    data = OneHandB, \n    aes(x = reorder(Player, -No), weight = BHWPct), fill = \"blue\") + coord_flip() + labs(\n    x=\"Player, by ATP rank\",\n    y=\"Backhand winner percentage\",\n    title=\"One-handed backhanders can't match two-handers' winners\", \n    subtitle = \"Backhand winners are rare, but they're even more rare for the few one-handed backhanders in the ATP top-15.\", caption = \"By: Emily Stoner | Source: TennisAbstract.com and ATP\") +  \n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.subtitle = element_textbox_simple(),\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 14, face = \"bold\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt’s hard to hit a winner with your backhand shot, but these two one-hand backhand guys are kind of at the back of the pack. Clearly this grip choice doesn’t hinder their game in a monumental way; these two guys are top-15 in a massive, competitive sport, but it is interesting to once again see how the things we think we don’t have as much control or focus on can still impact performance patterns.\nIn conclusion, there are tons of stats that don’t get analyzed in tennis. While things like surface preference, height, and grip choice get thrown around in broadcaster comments, the implications and patterns hardly get discussed. These charts show how much depth these “external” elements have, how they might impact the best tennis players, and how many stories are out there hidden behind numbers.\nAll data is reflective of standings at the conclusion of the 2024 ATP season."
